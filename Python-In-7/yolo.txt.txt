Holly Martins: an American writer of bad cowboy stories: Arrived in Vienna one cold morning in February. It was shortly after World War II: Vienna was in ruins and occupied by the four Allied powers, the Americans, the Russians, the British and the French. Holly Martins had been invited to Vienna: by an old friend, Harry Lime, and so he was surprised that Harry was not there to meet him. When Holly went to Harry's flat he found out that his friend had been hit and killed by a truck as he was crossing the street.
